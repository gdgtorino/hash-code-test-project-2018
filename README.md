This is a Java project that tries to provide a running implementation of the test project for Hash Code challenge 2018.

The input files are placed in `src\main\resources\input` folder and the output files will be generated in the root folder; in order to select which input file will be treated, the variables `INPUT_FILENAME` and `OUTPUT_FILENAME` in `Constants` class must change accordingly.

Please note that this project contains the Gradle wrapper `gradlew`; this means that you can type `./gradlew build` to execute the build task without installing Gradle on your machine.
For any other information about Gradle wrapper please follow the [official documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) from Gradle.

If you want to use the boilerplate project for Java code you can download the related [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gdgtorino/hash-code-starter-project).
